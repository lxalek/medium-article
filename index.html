    <h2>How to test your reality?</h2>
    <p>
      Anything that is reliable for you can be tested. Make sure to look everyday for something that you will be sure how it will physiclly look like.
    </p>

    <h2>What if it doesn't look as usual?</h2>
    <p>
      You are probably experimenting a lucid dream.
    </p>

    <a href="#" class="link-medium">Check the usuals physical landmarks to check everyday to make sure you a re not dreaming</a>

    <h2>And then what's next?</h2>
    <p>
      Don't panic, control your cardiac rythm and try to experience the lucid dream as there are infinite possibilities to create in your own world. As soon as you know that you are dreaming and you can stay asleep then you can build your dream.
